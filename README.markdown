# GEdit Multi Terminal Plugin

A modified terminal plugin for GEdit 3. It support multiple tabs.

It borrows code from the gedit 2 version by FaziBear over at 
https://github.com/fazibear/gedit-mterminal and from the Terminal plugin by 
Paolo Borelli shipped in the http://live.gnome.org/GeditPlugins package.

## How to install ? 

Clone to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ and enable mterminal plugin.

## How to use it ? 

To add new terminal right-click on terminal window and choose 'New Terminal'.
If you want to remove it, right-click and choose 'Remove Terminal'.

## Notes

This is very experimental, I don't use it myself at the moment. Report bugs and
